      Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist
      Kurt
      Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing,
      before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often
      referenced
      as the figurehead band of Generation X. Despite a short mainstream career spanning only three years, their music
      maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.</p>

      In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album,
      Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts,
      often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana
      found unexpected mainstream success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from its landmark second
      album
      Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry
      Association of America (RIAA) and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.</p>

      Characterized by a punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with its themes of
      abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992
      compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released its highly anticipated third studio album, In
      Utero (1993).
      The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following
      Cobain's
      suicide in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love.
      The live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
